i created three files in html file i created seven different buttons for each key and in my css file i did the styling on the buttons and heading and then in my js file to get the particular button element i used .queryselector to select the particular button , i did it for all the buttons then i add event listener to each of the button and added a keypress event in it in which after keypress a  funcion will be called in that function i store the key value and then another function will work in which i store the  url of music in a variable using new audio method and to play that particular music i used .play() function for checking which key was pressed i used switch case.
